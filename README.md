========

Second incarnation of a personal note-taking app. I'm seeing what I can do with a Workflowy-like app, because I like the idea of all of my notes being in essentially one big tree and being able to zoom in on parts of the tree. I need to spend some quality time actually using this app so  I can figure out where I want to go with it, but for now it's essentially a tweaked Workflowy clone with less features.
