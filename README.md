scraps2?
========

This may or may not end up being called a rewrite of "scraps," a previous note-taking application, because the format is entirely different even if the goal is the same. The idea I'm working off of now is a personal ajax wiki, so in fact it's not a "wiki" in the sense that it enables collaborative editing. It is only a wiki in the sense that there are named pages of content that can be linked to one another.
